## Hi, I'm Luke 👋

I'm a Computer Science Honours graduate who's passionate about developing software 🖥️, websites 🌐 and games 🎮!

🤔 I'm currently working on revising my web development skills.

## Projects

Check out my projects below:

🖥️ [ManimRT (2024)](https://github.com/62firelight/manimRT-490) - A plugin for Manim (a Python library for creating programmatic animations) that makes it easy to create animations for explaining ray tracing. Further documentation is available on its [wiki](https://github.com/62firelight/manimRT-490/wiki). This plugin was created as part of my year-long Honours project.

🌐 [Destiny 2 Zero Hour Solver (2023)](https://github.com/62firelight/d2-zero-hour-solver)  - A React web app that functions as a resource hub for the Zero Hour exotic mission in Destiny 2, a live service game.

🌐 [Mass Effect 2 Final Mission Calculator (2023)](https://github.com/62firelight/ME2FMC) - A React web app that calculates the possible outcomes for the final mission of Mass Effect 2, my all-time favourite game.
